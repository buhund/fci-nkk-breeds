# NKK and FCI Dog Breed Database

fci-nkk-breeds


Overview of all currently recognized dog breeds, as per the Norwegian Kennel Club (NKK) and Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) 2024-01-01.

### Inaccuracies

Some images may be of the wrong breed. I do not know every single breed by looks, and thus have relied on online resources to try finding images that match the breed. Some breeds are less common than others, and therefore more difficult to find good or accurate images of, and not knowing exactly how they look leaves me having to take the uploader's word for it.

### License

All images belong to whomever took them (not me). I have here assumed [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), but will remove any image if the owner requests it.

Any breed standards linked are from the NKK or FCI, and are linked to their respective pages. They are not mine, and I have no rights to them. They are linked here for educational purposes only.


### Rights and Disclaimer

All images have been found on the Internet via image search. All rights to these images belong to the person who owns it. If you find an image here that you own, and do not want to be used here, please let me know and I'll have it removed.

As of now, they're used under "Fair Use", are not used for commercial purposes, and in good faith. I intend only to use them to show what the given breed looks like and hope it's OK that your dog, or image, was used to represent the breed.
